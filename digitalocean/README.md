## Summary

ShinyProxy is an open source platform to deploy R Shiny applications at scale in companies and
larger organizations. Shiny applications are interactive web applications for bringing data
science to end users.

ShinyProxy builds on enterprise Java and Docker technology to meet corporate needs in deploying
Shiny applications, such as authentication, authorization (LDAP, ActiveDirectory,
Social login, etc.) and secure traffic, allocating resources (CPU, memory limits) per
Shiny application, usage statistics and administrator views for monitoring,
API for integrating of Shiny apps in larger applications.

The 1-Click option makes it easier than ever to deploy ShinyProxy on DigitalOcean droplets
in fully-tested app environments.
